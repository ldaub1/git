Wrote a program that initializes a Git repository -> generateGitDirectory() in gitRepository file
1. Returns message if it all already exists (doesn't continue to the rest of the method)
2. Attempts to creating whatever is missing
3. Returns Output (Git Repository Created) ._. (go print it yourself, see tester for sample)

Wrote a tester (removes any files, creates them, tests already made case) 
    -> tests multiple times to ensure robustness >:(
